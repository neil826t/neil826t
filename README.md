### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for visiting my github. Like most things in my life, it is a work in progress but I'm happy with what I've learned to get to this point.

A lot of my repositories are still educational since I'm still a student. The other repositories are mostly personal projects, a lot of which I made when I was young before I knew about github.

I love talking to people about the things I've done and I'm working on; feel free to shoot me an email with any questions at neli826t@gmail.com.
